The human body the universe

The universe is space and time,

Planets, stars, galaxies,

All forms of matter and energy.

Fear of the unknown,

In the multivariate hypothesis,

The existence of the human universe,

Cells, planets,     

Blood, Milky Way

The viscera and the six viscera and the five elements

Maybe,

We are universe.
